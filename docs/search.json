    "text": "Hello! My name is Salvatore Caradonna, though I go by Sonny. I am a current MD-PhD trainee at Case Western Reserve University. I am currently working in the lab of Dr. Andrew Pieper investigating the pathophysiology behind neurodegenerative diseases and exploring my interests in psychiatry and neurology. Outside of my professional work I enjoy my pickleball league, violin with my chamber group, and disco music on the dance floor. Feel free to learn more about me from my website!"
